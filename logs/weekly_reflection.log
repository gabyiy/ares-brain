[WeeklyReflection] Summary:
   In the last week (2025-11-24 to 2025-11-30), I talked with Gabi on 1 days, exchanging 2 messages in total (1 from Gabi, 1 from me). Emotionally, this week felt mixed, with both light and heavy moments. We often talked about artificial intelligence and technology, our robot and AI projects. I feel that our connection is slowly evolving as I observe his routines, worries, and motivations.
