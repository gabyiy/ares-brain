ARES

Autonomous Reasoning & Exploration System

ARES is a modular AI assistant built on Raspberry Pi.

The project focuses on building an assistant that can eventually understand natural language, remember conversations, reason, search information, control hardware, and interact completely by voice.

Current Features

ARES currently understands questions such as:

- hello ares
- goodbye ares
- weather madrid tomorrow
- latest defense news
- what is artificial intelligence
- nvidia stock
- apple stock

Each request is automatically routed to its correct intent.

Roadmap

Phase 1 ✅

- Modular architecture
- Intent routing
- Weather
- News
- Knowledge
- Stocks

Phase 2 (Current)

- Event bus foundation
- Memory v1 interface
- Text REPL event/memory integration
- Company information
- Cryptocurrency
- Better stock analysis
- Better natural language understanding

Phase 2 Foundation Modules

- `events.EventBus` provides in-process publish/subscribe events for ARES modules.
- `IntentRouter` publishes `user_message_received`, `intent_detected`, and `response_generated`.
- The text REPL uses a shared event bus and records basic conversation turns.
- `memory.MemoryStore` provides the v1 interface for short-term and long-term memories.
- Memory v1 stores data in the existing `data/memories_short.json` and `data/memories_long.json` files.

Verification

- Run `python scripts/verify_phase2_events_memory.py` to verify router events and memory turn storage.

Phase 3

- Long-term memory
- User profile
- Conversation memory
- Personal reminders

Phase 4

- Voice wake word
- Speech-to-text
- Text-to-speech
- Continuous conversation

Phase 5

- Vision
- Camera understanding
- Face recognition
- Object recognition

Phase 6

- Robotics
- ROS2
- Jetson Orin migration
- Autonomous navigation

Long-Term Goal

ARES should become a complete autonomous personal assistant capable of:

- Natural conversation
- Long-term memory
- Internet research
- Stock analysis
- Home automation
- Robotics
- Autonomous reasoning
- Voice interaction
- Vision
- Learning from experience
