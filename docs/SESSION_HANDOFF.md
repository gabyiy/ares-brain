ARES Session Handoff

Current Version

ARES v1.0

Current Status

The project has been fully reorganized into a modular architecture.

The original monolithic "intent_router.py" has been split into separate intent modules.

Phase 2 foundation work has started.

New foundation modules:

- Event Bus
- Memory v1 interface

Current Phase 2 wiring:

- Text REPL uses a shared event bus.
- Intent Router publishes the public Phase 2 events.
- Text REPL stores basic conversation turns through MemoryStore v1.

Phase 3 planning/foundation has started.

New Phase 3 skill modules:

- `skills.Skill`
- `skills.SkillContext`
- `skills.SkillResponse`
- `skills.SkillRegistry`
- `skills.SkillManager`
- `skills.SkillPlugin`
- `skills.builtin.TimeDateSkill`

The skill layer is minimally wired into the text REPL through `IntentRouter`.
Normal intents still run first; SkillManager is only a fallback when no intent matches.
Voice work has not started.

Phase 4 long-term memory recall has started.

New memory recall modules:

- `memory.UserProfileStore`
- `memory.detect_profile_facts`
- `skills.builtin.MemoryRecallSkill`

User profile facts are stored separately from conversation history.
The default profile path is `data/user_profile.json`, which is ignored by git to avoid committing personal facts.
The profile path can be overridden with `ARES_USER_PROFILE_PATH` for tests.

Automated tests have been added.

New test coverage:

- Event bus
- MemoryStore v1
- UserProfileStore
- MemoryRecallSkill
- SkillRegistry and SkillManager
- TimeDateSkill
- Text REPL profile recall flow

Pytest is configured to collect only `tests/`, because legacy interactive scripts under `scripts/` also use `test_*.py` names.

Strict engineering rules have been added in `docs/ENGINEERING_RULES.md`.

Required rules going forward:

- Never skip, xfail, or weaken failing tests without explicit approval.
- Never hide errors with broad try/except blocks.
- Fix root causes rather than symptoms.
- Keep the full verification suite passing before every push.
- Update README and SESSION_HANDOFF after every meaningful change.

Master planning documents have been added.

New planning docs:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`

These documents explain the current system flow, event bus, intent router, memory stores, skill system, REPL flow, future integration points, completed phases, current state, next priorities, blocked work, and testing rules before each phase.

Current working intents:

- Greeting
- Goodbye
- Weather
- News
- Knowledge
- Stocks

Current providers:

- Weather Provider
- News Provider
- Wikipedia Provider
- Knowledge Provider
- Alpha Vantage Stock Provider

The stock provider now uses Alpha Vantage instead of Yahoo Finance due to Yahoo's authentication restrictions.

Event Bus:

- New `events.EventBus` supports in-process publish/subscribe.
- Subscribers can listen to one event name or `"*"` for all events.
- `IntentRouter` now publishes `user_message_received`, `intent_detected`, and `response_generated`.
- Existing internal aliases remain: `input.received`, `intent.empty`, `intent.matched`, `intent.response`, and `intent.unmatched`.

Memory v1:

- New `memory.MemoryStore` reads the existing `data/memories_short.json` and `data/memories_long.json` files.
- New `memory.MemoryRecord` normalizes legacy memory entries without rewriting files until a write happens.
- Supports `remember`, `recall`, `promote`, `clear`, and `stats`.
- Publishes `memory.recorded`, `memory.promoted`, and `memory.cleared` events.

User Profile:

- Detects `My name is...`
- Detects `I live in...`
- Detects `My birthday is...`
- Detects `My favorite ... is...`
- Detects `I own...`
- Publishes `profile.fact_saved`

Text REPL memory:

- `interfaces.text_repl` creates one shared event bus and passes it to `IntentRouter` and `MemoryStore`.
- Each text response records a short-term `conversation_turn` memory.
- Each text input is also scanned for user profile facts.
- Sleeping-mode responses also emit `user_message_received` and `response_generated`.
- The text REPL now also registers the built-in skill plugin.

Previous v0.7 modules compiled successfully.

Current Phase 2 foundation changes passed git whitespace checks locally.

Current Architecture

Intent Router
        │
        ├── EventBus lifecycle events
        │
        ├── GreetingIntent
        ├── GoodbyeIntent
        ├── WeatherIntent
        ├── NewsIntent
        ├── KnowledgeIntent
        └── StockIntent

Each intent owns its own logic and communicates with its corresponding provider.

MemoryStore v1 is separate from the legacy `memory_manager.py` API so existing scripts keep working.

Skill Manager

Immediate Next Milestone

Company Information Provider

ARES should understand:

- Tell me about Nvidia
- What does Apple do?
- Explain Rheinmetall
- Who owns Tesla?

Next technical choices:

- Add profile acknowledgement responses if desired; current fact statements are stored even when the response is generic.
- Keep voice out of scope until text skill execution is stable.
- Connect selected daily reflection scripts and future providers to MemoryStore v1.

Future Roadmap

1. Company Provider
2. Cryptocurrency Provider
3. Better reasoning
4. Skill manager integration with text flow
5. Memory v1 integration with conversations
6. Long-term memory retrieval
7. Company profile provider
8. Voice interface
9. Vision
10. Robotics
11. Jetson Orin migration
12. Autonomous ARES

Verification Notes

- `scripts/verify_phase2_events_memory.py` verifies router event publication and memory turn storage with temporary memory files.
- Run it with `python scripts/verify_phase2_events_memory.py`.
- Automated tests run with `py -m pytest`.
- Phase 3 skill package compiles with `py -m compileall skills`.
- `SkillManager` was manually checked with the built-in time/date skill.
- Text REPL was verified with `hello`, `what time is it`, `what date is it`, and `quit`.
- Long-term profile recall was verified through the text REPL with name, location, birthday, favorite tank, and owned item facts.
- Current verification passed:
  - `py -m pytest`
  - `py -m compileall core interfaces events memory skills scripts`
  - `py scripts\verify_phase2_events_memory.py`
- `git diff --check` passed after the automated test changes.
- Runtime Python checks may not be available in some Windows sessions if `python`/`py` are not installed, only Microsoft Store aliases are present.
- Config and logging were left unchanged because the event bus and memory v1 work did not require changes there.

Latest Commits

- `0faffc1` Add long-term profile memory recall

Next Planned Step

- Review and approve roadmap/architecture documents.
- Do not add roadmap implementation yet.
- Do not start voice yet.
